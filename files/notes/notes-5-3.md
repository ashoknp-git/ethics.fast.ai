# Lesson 5.3: Losing the Forest for the Trees, guest lecture by Ali Alkhatib

We turn our messy world into data to reason about it and to inform actions. That's become a growing problem as we build systems directly out of that data. People respond and begin performing for the algorithms that dictate our lives. CADE Research Fellow Ali Alkhatib draws on the history of HCI, James Scott's Seeing Like a State, and current issues in data ethics in discussing the issues that arise when we uncritically build algorithmic systems on historical foundations of greed exploitation, and harm.
